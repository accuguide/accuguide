## Setup

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/)
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/)

### Installation

1. `git clone https://github.com/accuguide/accuguide.git`
2. `bun install`
3. `cp .env.example .env`

### Optional Configuration

These steps are only required if you need the corresponding features to work locally.

| Feature | Steps |
|---|---|
| Search | Register a free [Google Maps API key](https://console.cloud.google.com/). Limit quotas (e.g. 10 req/min, 100 req/day). Add the key to both `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` fields in `.env`. |
| Google OAuth | In your Google Cloud project, configure the OAuth consent screen. Set Authorized JS origin to `http://localhost:3000` and redirect URI to `http://localhost:3000/login/google/callback`. Add the Client ID and Secret to `.env`. |
| AI Summaries | Register a free [Groq API key](https://console.groq.com/) and add it to the appropriate field in `.env`. |

> **Note:** Donation and email features are currently unavailable for local development due to complex setup requirements.

### Running the App

1. `bun dev`
2. `bun run s3:push`

For initial database setup or to reset the database:

- `bun db:push` — applies schema changes
- `bun db:seed` — resets to seed data

> **Tip:** If Docker has volume issues after the postgres:17 → postgres:18 upgrade, run `docker compose down -v`, stop all services, then run `bun dev` again.
